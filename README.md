The `midi-to-audio` project includes implementation of fine-tuning the model with ATEPP as well as with score-audio pairs.

The `score-to-performance` project includes implementation of a midi-to-midi model, aiming to add expression to the given scores and output performance midis.

The `midi-valle` project implements VALL-E model for synthesising performance midis.
